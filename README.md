## Overview 🔍
This repository contains MATLAB code developed for the Master’s thesis project titled "Enhancing Acoustic Monitoring in Noisy Pig Barns." The project aims to improve acoustic monitoring through the design of fixed beamformers applied to six-channel circular microphone arrays. This research focuses on enhancing disease management and animal welfare in pig barns by optimizing acoustic data collection despite challenging noisy environments.
